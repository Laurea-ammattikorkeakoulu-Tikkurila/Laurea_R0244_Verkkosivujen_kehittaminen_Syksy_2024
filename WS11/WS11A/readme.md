# Advanced CSS Features

This project demonstrates advanced CSS features through a series of tasks. Each task focuses on a specific CSS property and its effects.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Box Shadow

Change the `box-shadow` values to see how different offsets and colors affect the shadow.

Example:
```css
box-shadow: 5px 5px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7);
```

### Task 2: Text Shadow

Modify the `text-shadow` values to see how different offsets and colors affect the text shadow.

Example:
```css
text-shadow: 1px 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
```

### Task 3: Background Size

Change the `background-size` property to different values like `contain`, `50% 50%`, `100% 100%`, etc., and observe how the background image scales.

Example:
```css
background-size: contain;
```

### Task 4: Additional Challenges

Add more elements and apply different combinations of `box-shadow`, `text-shadow`, and `background-size`. Create a button with a hover effect that changes the `box-shadow` and `background-size`.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to see the tasks.
2. Modify the CSS properties in the `styles/styles.css` file to complete each task.
3. Observe the changes in the browser to understand the effects of different CSS properties.
